- 👋 Hi, I’m Yrjö Koski (@ykoski), a Ph.D. student at the University of Helsinki
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, deep learning and especially the combination of these two!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to process large files, such nanopore sequencing data, with python and how to efficiently use this data with PyTorch models. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the topics above. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
- 📫 How to reach me: The best way to reach me is by email: ymkoski (a) gmail.com

I will release code for the methods that I have developed for my research here. You can also expect to see code from other projects that I think could be helpful for others.
